              Confusing positioning: Understanding the differences between
              static, relative, absolute, and fixed positioning often trips
              beginners up. Flexbox and Grid headaches: Modern layout tools like
              Flexbox and CSS Grid are powerful, but knowing when and how to use
              them can be intimidating. Cross-browser inconsistencies: What
              looks perfect in one browser can break in another, leaving
              beginners unsure how to fix it. Responsive design challenges:
              Making layouts that look good on both mobile and desktop often
              feels like juggling too many moving parts. Debugging frustration:
              Small mistakes in CSS can cascade and create unexpected layout
              issues, and beginners often don’t know how to identify the
              problem.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our course solves these problems by providing: Clear visual
              examples for every layout concept, making abstract CSS rules
              easier to understand. Interactive demos that let users experiment
              with Flexbox, Grid, and other layout techniques in real time.
              Step-by-step guidance for building layouts that work across
              different screen sizes and browsers. Troubleshooting tips to help
              users quickly identify and fix common CSS mistakes. In short, we
              take the mystery and frustration out of layouts so beginners can
              build responsive, visually appealing websites with confidence.
